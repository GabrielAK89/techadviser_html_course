            <h1>1. Requirements</h1>

            <h2>What do I need to start developing with HTML?</h2>

            <div>
                There are absolutely no requirements to start learning HTML, but you will need some tools to help you
                along the way. There are two tools that are essential to becoming an efficient and professional Web
                Developer.
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Firstly, you will need a Text Editor. Windows users, you can get an awesome text editor from
                notepadplusplus.org. As you have probably guessed from the name of the URL, this text editor is Notepad
                ++
                and includes some cool syntax highlighting! Mac fans, you can get a text editor from Bare Bones. This
                handy text editor-Text wrangler also supports syntax highlighting for a range of programming
                languages. Personally I use Text Wrangler. Linux lovers, you can use the default gnome text editorgedit.
                If it’s not already installed, you can get it over here at gnome.org.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Do I need syntax highlighting? What is syntax highlighting?</h2>

            <p>
                Syntax highlighting allows you to easily see certain elements of your code in a designated color. For
                example, when using a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor with syntax highlighting
                some editors may render the HTML structure as blue, comments as grey and attributes and values as
                different colors. This allows you to easily distinguish between the sections of code, elements and
                comments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, you will need a browser to render your code. I recommend Firefox. We will download and
                install Mozilla's Firefox (Cross-platform) Browser and the Firebug add-on for Firefox. The Firebug
                add-on will be your new best friend as a learned web developer. The Fire-bug Firefox add-on provides
                the ability to closely "inspect" the elements of an HTML document and see what’s going on behind the
                scenest his will play a big part in your web development career!
                Alternatively you can use any other browser that supports HTML5- including Safari, Google’s Chrome
                and Opera.
            </p>

            <h1>2. Introduction to HTML</h1>

            <h2>Definition of HTML</h2>

            <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark-up Language. HTML is the basis for all things Web and is a
                necessary skill for any Web Developer. Almost every website is comprised of HTML whether that is a
                variation of HTML or plain old HTML.</p>

            <h2>Structure </h2>

            <p>Let's start with a basic HTML5 structure: </p>

            <p>The first thing we should do is set up the skeleton of the page.</p>
            <p>
                a. Always put<span style="color: rgb(105, 146, 200)"> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </span>on the first line. This tells the browser what language it's reading (in
                this case, HTML).
            </p>
            <p>b. Always put<span style="color: rgb(105, 146, 200)"> &lt;html&gt; </span>on the next line. This starts the HTML document.</p>
            <p>c. Always put<span style="color: rgb(105, 146, 200)"> &lt;/html&gt; </span>on the last line. This ends the HTML document.</p>
